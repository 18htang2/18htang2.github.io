        <p id="reflection"> Game Reflection: The purpose of my game is to make sure
        my grade remains decent in this class. I used the incremental process to
        test each individual script to see if they perform the intended function
        I used the iterative process to after each completion of a stage by replaying
        the game to see if the code was working. Some difficulties that encountered
        was how to implement a change in the stages which was resolved by a screen
        indicating what button to press to move on but would been better resolved
        if I created a continue button sprite. Another difficulty was in the
        movement of the sprites which often conflicted which was resolved by taking
        advantage of the broadcast to change the script and using the "and" operator
        to reduce conflicts in the code. </p>

        Interactive Fiction Reflection: I had control of creativity of the project
        as I was responsible for thinking up and typing the story, so no programming
        skills were necessary for my part. I didn't have problem except for writer's
        block. I am neutral towards my work as I like the message that I was building on,
        but I lacked enough time to fully developed the plot like how I imagined it.
        I want a high fantasy setting but the story ended more like low fantasy. I 
        like the story Hole to Oblivion or something of the sort as it was very well-
        developed and had implemented many unique ideas in their story. Ultimately, I felt
        the story would have been better if I have given more options and not rush
        on developing the climax and conclusion of the story. </p>
