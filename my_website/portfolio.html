        <p id="reflection"> Reflection: The purpose of my game is to make sure
        my grade remains decent in this class. I used the incremental process to
        test each individual script to see if they perform the intended function
        I used the iterative process to after each completion of a stage by replaying
        the game to see if the code was working. Some difficulties that encountered
        was how to implement a change in the stages which was resolved by a screen
        indicating what button to press to move on but would been better resolved
        if I created a continue button sprite. Another difficulty was in the
        movement of the sprites which often conflicted which was resolved by taking
        advantage of the broadcast to change the script and using the "and" operator
        to reduce conflicts in the code.</p>
